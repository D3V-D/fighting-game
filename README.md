# fighting-game
Made with the help of a tutorial, then improved upon.

## Additions
- Start screen 
- Jump detection (no jump spamming) 
- Better hitboxes 
- Cannot walk through sides of the game
- Game is *more* responsive. Instead of 1024 x 576, now fullscreen. (Still, recommended to have a similar ratio). 
- Added music
